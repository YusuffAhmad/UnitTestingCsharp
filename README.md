# Unit Testing for C# Developers

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive guide to mastering unit testing in C#. It is based on the lessons from the "Unit Testing for C# Developers" course, which is designed to equip developers with the essential skills needed to write robust, maintainable, and testable code.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Importance of Automated Testing**: Understanding the critical role of automated testing in software development and the benefits it provides.
- **Writing Effective Unit Tests**: Techniques for verifying the correctness of individual units of code.
- **Utilizing Mocking Frameworks**: How to create test doubles and isolate dependencies for more effective unit testing.
- **Refactoring Legacy Code**: Methods to transform legacy, untestable code into loosely-coupled, testable code.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Implementing DI to improve the testability of your code.
